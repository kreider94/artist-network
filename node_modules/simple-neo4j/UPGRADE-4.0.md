## Overview

Version 4.0 breaks changes with previous versions but hopefully the upgrade will
go smoothly for you if you have a pre 4.0 version.

Callbacks are removed entirely in favor of promises, this includes the multiple
callback feature as promises can only be resolved once. Many methods now take
a configuration object rather than several parameters.

`updateCredentials` was removed in favor of `update` which does the same thing
but allows better control and allows setting any class variables not just
credentials.

## What needs to change

The change required was minimized best as possible, its works nearly identical
to the previous version. The only large change will, of course, be the switch
from callbacks to promises.

The way things work now is this

1. You instantiate the class like normal using a configuration object rather
   than passed parameters.
2. Work with it like normal
3. When using addQuery, it will now return a Promise instead of you providing
   a callback and you can now pass in the query string itself, a configuration
   object, or an array consisting of strings and/or objects. So its a lot more
   flexible.
4. When the transaction is finished processing, the promises will be resolved

For a clearer summary:

* Constructor takes one object of class properties instead of several parameters
* addQuery is flexible in that it takes two parameters. The first is the query
  which can be a string, object, or array of strings and/or objects. The second
  is optional and is the queue name if desired to add the query to a different
  transactional queue
* addQuery now also returns a promise rather than you passing in a callback like
  before
* execute was added as a shortcut to bypass addQuery/commit and execute queries
  right then and there. It has a similar setup as addQuery and commit combined
  whereby the parameters are `(query, raw)` and returns a promise.
* commit now takes an additional and optional queue name as the second parameter
  in case a custom queue name was specified with addQuery.

## And your done

Thats the upgrade switch from 3.x and before to 4.x
