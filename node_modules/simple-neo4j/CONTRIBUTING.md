Contributing
====================

Contributing back is encouraged and simple

1. Simply fork the project if you haven't already done so
2. Make whatever changes you want to
3. Run `npm run prepublish` which will build your changes and perform a few
   tests for code quality and correctness
4. Commit, push, and send a pull-request
