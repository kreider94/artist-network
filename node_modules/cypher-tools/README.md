## About

Cypher tools makes working with Cypher a bit more fun, currently its still
in its early stages but aims to be a general toolset for cypher queries.

## Using Cypher Tools

* Object to String (objToString)

  Converts an object to something like JSON but in a way that's readable by
  and includable in a cypher query. Great for times when Cypher parameters
  can't be used and you must resort to string building

      objToString({
        movie: "The One",
        genre: "Action"
      })

      // Returns
      // '{ movie: "The One", genre: "Action" }'

* Object to Parameters (objToParams)

  Converts an object to something like JSON, very similar to above, but the
  resulting string doesn't provide the values in the values field like above.
  It instead tells Neo4J to look for the values in a provided parameter. In other
  words, a loopback object string.

  This is needed in situations where an object parameter can be used but the
  parameter can't be used directly, only the parameter contents.

  A good example is the predicate in a match or merge statement, you can't
  do this `match ({predicate})` but you can do this
  `match ({key: {predicate}.key})`. That's essentially what this method does.

      objToParams("predicate", {
        movie: "The One",
        genre: "Action"
      })

     // Returns
     // '{ movie: {predicate}.movie, genre: {predicate}.genre }'

  **Note**: Always use parameters wherever possible, for a number of reasons,
  among them is faster code, speed, and many automated optimizations on the
  database side.

* Labels to String (labelsToString)

  Converts an array of labels to a string, a simple and quick helper function
  but very useful.

      labelsToString(["Movie", "Action"])

      // Returns
      // ":Movie:Action"

## Run it in your browser

Thanks to TonicDev, you now have a way to run this package right in your
browser to test it out. If your on the NPM site you can see the TonicDev link on
the right-hand side, otherwise you can always go to the link below.

TonicDev will load up a preset example we provide that you can play around with
to get a feel for this package.

## How to develop
-----------------

To develop, `git clone` this repository and `npm install` to install the
development dependencies. Make sure to run `npm run build` when
needed such as before tests and such which will compile ES6/7 to ES5 and
re-generate the docs. You can run those individually if you want with
`npm run docs` and `npm run compile`.

For testing, just run `npm run test`

Then just push the changes and send a pull-request back

This project makes use of github project pages using the "gh-pages" branch and
JSDoc for all documentation and tutorials. So the way things are done for the
docs is this

1. Compile and test docs in master branch until happy
2. Commit to git
3. Run `npm run pages`
 * This will switch to the gh-pages branch, merge from master, and switch back
4. Run `git push --all`

## Documentation
-----------------

Detailed documentation exists for this package, it should already by viewable
on clone. Feel free to look through it for any questions you may have. The
source code is also heavily documented if you want to look through it
as well for answers.

Online docs exist here http://russellstoolbox.github.io/cypher-tools/docs
