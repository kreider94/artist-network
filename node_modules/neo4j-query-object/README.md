## Upgrade to 2.0

2.0 brings in a lot of big changes and consequently breaks support with
pre 2.0 versions. If you have version 1.x or before make sure to read
UPGRADE-2.0.md. Essentially callbacks were removed in favor of promises which
required many alterations to the existing class.

## About

This is a class who is designed to hold one instance per query. It self manages
a promise along with the query itself and various other data. Its designed to
store this query and other data until the query is processed and result received
in which case you simply issue the promise via `issuePromise` providing any
errors and results whereby the class will properly resolve or reject the
promise with the result obj.

## Only a means for storage

This class does not contain any code for calling any database nor does it
contain any code for parsing any result from the database. It's merely a storage
object for code that does do those tasks to use making things much easier.

## Generic but Neo4J-Feel

Technically this class can be used for anything, not just Neo4J. In fact it
doesn't even have to be used for a query. But, despite this, it has the look and
feel of the Neo4J-Line - A line of packages that are separate but work together
to form the Neo4J system of packages.

For example in this class you'll see properties like `raw`, `parameters`,
`first-value`, etc... These are generic to any kind of implementation and
don't have to be used but they're inspired from the needs of the other packages
in the Nei4J line so they're going to have that feel to them.

## This package is solid

This package is actively tested with Jasmine and thoroughly documented
throughout. It also contains complete JSDoc comments and full online JSDoc
generated documentation.

## How to develop
-----------------

To develop, `git clone` this repository and `npm install` to install the
development dependencies. Make sure to run `npm run build` when
needed such as before tests and such which will compile ES6/7 to ES5 and
re-generate the docs. You can run those individually if you want with
`npm run docs` and `npm run compile`.

For testing, just run `npm run test`

Then just push the changes and send a pull-request back

This project makes use of github project pages using the "gh-pages" branch and
JSDoc for all documentation and tutorials. So the way things are done for the
docs is this

1. Compile and test docs in master branch until happy
2. Commit to git
3. Run `npm run pages`
* This will switch to the gh-pages branch, merge from master, and switch back
4. Run `git push --all`


## Documentation
-----------------

Detailed documentation exists for this package, it should already by viewable
on clone. Feel free to look through it for any questions you may have. The
source code is also heavily documented if you want to look through it
as well for answers.

Online docs exist here http://russellstoolbox.github.io/neo4j-query-object/docs
