Version 2.0.2
====================
* Several updates and fixes overall

Version 2.0.0
====================

**Version 2 breaks changes with previous versions, see UPGRADE-2.0.md**

* callbacks were removed in favor of more efficient promise system
* since a promise can only be resolved once, the multi-callback system was also
  removed, this was a very difficult decision but the promise system has many
  advantages that outweigh the cb system.
* Eslint installed as dependency and integrated as part of npm scripts
* src files now fully eslint satisfied
* dev branch created for development, master branch now only for releases
* tagging now for master merges
* tonic example updated
* README makeover including ascii chart
* Contributing moved out of readme to its own file
* examples vastly updated with better support all-together
* removal of .jshintrc, its old feeling, a bit behind, and clashed with eslint in
  many ways
